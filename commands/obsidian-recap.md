description: Summarize a time period from the vault - today, week, or month

Use the obsidian-second-brain skill. Execute `/obsidian-recap $ARGUMENTS`:

The argument is the period: `today`, `week`, or `month`. Default to `week` if not specified.

1. Read `index.md` first if it exists in the bundle root. If `_CLAUDE.md` exists, treat it as an extension file that may refine local conventions
2. Determine the date range from the argument
3. List all daily notes in the range with `list_files_in_dir("Daily/")`
4. Spawn parallel subagents - one per daily note - to read and extract key points from each simultaneously
5. Also spawn parallel agents to read dev logs and completed kanban tasks from the same period
6. Synthesize all agent results: what was worked on, decisions made, people interacted with, tasks completed, ideas captured
7. Present as a clean narrative summary - not a raw dump of note content
8. End the recap with a **Suggested questions for future-Claude** section: 4 to 5 questions this period's vault content is uniquely positioned to answer that the user has not asked yet. Each question must cite at least one specific note reference so future-Claude can resolve it without re-scanning. Prefer relative Markdown links in OKF-first bundles, and preserve `[[wikilinks]]` only when the surrounding bundle is still Obsidian-native. Prefer questions that:
   - Surface tensions across notes (e.g., "Why does the X decision in note A contradict the rationale in note B?")
   - Connect entities that co-appeared but were never explicitly linked
   - Identify unstated next actions implied by the period's work
   Avoid generic prompts ("What did I work on?") - the recap already answers those.

**AI-first rule:** Every note created or updated by this command MUST follow `references/ai-first-rules.md` - `## For future Claude` preamble, rich frontmatter (`type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields), recency markers per external claim, relative Markdown links as the canonical internal link format, and any Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` preserved only as a compatibility extension when the surrounding bundle still uses them. Sources must remain verbatim with URLs inline, with confidence levels where applicable. The persisted bundle is for future-Claude retrieval, not for human reading first.

**Anti-fabrication:** Search exhaustively before claiming any note, person, or file is absent - false absence is the most common failure mode - and never invent facts, entities, or dates (mark unknowns as `TBD`). See the anti-fabrication and search-completeness hard rules in `references/ai-first-rules.md`.
