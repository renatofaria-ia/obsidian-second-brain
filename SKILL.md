# Obsidian Second Brain

> Claude operates an OKF-first knowledge bundle that may be stored in an Obsidian vault. The core persisted contract is `index.md` + `log.md` + typed UTF-8 Markdown documents.
> AI-first rules, runtime files such as `_CLAUDE.md`, and Obsidian-native conventions remain explicit fork extensions layered on top of that base contract.

---

## Quick Start

### 0. Choose vault access method (in order of preference)

Try these methods in order. Use the first one available:

**Method 0 - SessionStart hook (if configured):**
If `hooks/load_vault_context.py` is wired as a SessionStart hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`, `index.md` and any root extension files are injected into context automatically at session start. Skip step 1 below.
To wire it: `bash scripts/setup.sh "/path/to/vault"` or run `/obsidian-setup`.

**Method A - Direct filesystem (default, always works):**
Use standard file tools against the vault path. The vault is plain markdown, so every operation in this skill works this way with no setup. This is the normal path in Claude Code - the commands below use these tools directly.

**Method B - MCP server (optional, mainly for non-Claude-Code clients):**
This repo ships its own MCP server at `integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/` that exposes the vault as tools (`obsidian_search`, `obsidian_read_note`, `obsidian_save_note`, `obsidian_capture`, plus curator tools). It exists so other MCP clients - Hermes Agent, Claude Desktop, Cursor - can use the vault as a knowledge layer; in Claude Code itself, Method A is simpler and preferred. If those `obsidian_*` tools happen to be available in your client, you may use them instead of raw file tools. Setup lives in `integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/README.md` (it is `uv run --with mcp python .../server.py` with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` set, not an `npx` package).

### 1. First time in a bundle -> read `index.md`, then extension files

Before doing anything in a vault, check whether `index.md` exists at the bundle root and read it first:

```
Read <vault>/index.md
```

If it exists: treat it as the bundle front door and the primary navigation surface.
If `_CLAUDE.md` exists: read it next as an extension file that may refine local conventions, folder names, frontmatter details, or auto-save behavior.
If `index.md` does not exist but `_CLAUDE.md` does: read `_CLAUDE.md` as a transitional extension file and treat the vault as a legacy pre-OKF bundle.
If neither exists: use the defaults in this skill, then offer to create the canonical root files with `/obsidian-init`.

If the SessionStart hook is active, `index.md` and any extension files may already be in context - skip this step.

### 2. First time with a new user → run discovery

```
Glob <vault>/**/*.md
```

Scan the structure to understand: folder names, template locations, naming conventions, frontmatter patterns. Then read 2-3 existing notes to calibrate writing style before creating anything new.

### 3. Bootstrap a new vault

If the user has no vault yet, run:
```bash
# One-line install + bootstrap (asks 3 questions: vault path, your name, preset)
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash

# Or manual:
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/path/to/vault --name "Your Name"

# With a preset:
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset executive
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset builder
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset creator
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset researcher

# With assistant mode (maintaining vault for someone else):
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --mode assistant --subject "Boss Name"
```

Then just point the skill at the new vault path (Method A above). If you use the optional bundled MCP server, set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to the new path and restart the client.

**Presets** customize the vault for different use cases:
- **`executive`** - Decisions, people, meetings, strategic planning. Kanban: OKRs, Quarterly, Weekly.
- **`builder`** - Projects, dev logs, architecture decisions, debugging. Kanban: Backlog, Sprint, Done.
- **`creator`** - Content calendar, ideas pipeline, audience notes, publishing. Kanban: Ideas, Drafts, Published.
- **`researcher`** - Sources, literature notes, hypotheses, methodology. Kanban: Reading, Processing, Synthesized.

Default (no preset) gives a general-purpose vault. All presets preserve the same OKF core contract and add one default folder layout.

**Assistant mode** creates a `_CLAUDE.md` configured for operating a vault on behalf of someone else. See `references/claude-md-assistant-template.md`.

See `references/vault-schema.md` for full structural details.

## Core Bundle Contract

Before applying any local workflow rules, anchor on the bundle contract:

1. Read `index.md` first when it exists at the bundle root. It is the canonical entrypoint.
2. Treat `log.md` as the canonical root operations log, even when the bundle also uses split per-day logs as an extension.
3. Persist knowledge as UTF-8 Markdown with YAML frontmatter and mandatory `type`.
4. Reserve `index.md` and `log.md`; never treat them as concept documents.
5. Use relative Markdown links as the canonical internal link format.
6. Treat `_CLAUDE.md`, `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`, AI-first rules, bi-temporal facts, kanban structures, and `[[wikilinks]]` as extension behavior layered on the base contract.
7. Whenever you change the persisted contract, command semantics, migration guidance, or validation expectations, also update the applicable release record under `docs/ofk/releases/` in the same change set.

### Path resolution rule
When command examples below mention concrete folders such as `wiki/`, `raw/`, `Daily/`, `Boards/`, `Projects/`, `People/`, `Knowledge/`, `Research/`, or `Logs/`, treat those paths as defaults or legacy layouts, not as part of the core OKF contract. Resolve actual write targets in this order:

1. `index.md` and the bundle's existing relative links
2. root extension files such as `_CLAUDE.md` or `CRITICAL_FACTS.md` when present
3. existing note placement patterns already used in the bundle
4. skill defaults only when the bundle is silent

Never invent a new top-level folder when the bundle already contains an equivalent location for the same note type.

## Core Operating Principles

### AI-first extension rule (applies to fork-managed notes)
AI-first is an explicit fork extension layered on top of the OKF base contract. It is the default writing mode for notes this skill creates or refreshes, but it is not itself the definition of bundle validity. When this extension is active, every note Claude writes should follow `references/ai-first-rules.md`:

1. **Self-contained context** - each note explains itself; don't rely on backlinks alone
2. **"For future Claude" preamble** - 2-3 sentence summary so Claude can decide relevance in 10 seconds
3. **Rich, consistent frontmatter** - `type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields (see `ai-first-rules.md` for schemas per note type)
4. **Recency markers per claim** - "Mem0 raised $24M (as of 2026-04, mem0.ai)" so future-Claude knows what to verify
5. **Sources preserved verbatim** - every external claim has its source URL inline
6. **Cross-links mandatory** - every person, project, idea, decision, or concept uses an internal note link; relative Markdown links are canonical, and `[[wikilinks]]` are compatibility-only for Obsidian-native bundles
7. **Confidence levels** - `stated | high | medium | speculation` where applicable

This extension is defined canonically in `references/ai-first-rules.md` (frontmatter schemas + preamble templates per note type). `index.md` remains the canonical bundle entrypoint; `_CLAUDE.md` may restate or refine local conventions as an optional extension file.

### Never create in isolation
Every write operation must ask: *where else does this belong?*

| You create/update... | Also update... |
|---|---|
| A new project note | Kanban board (add to Backlog), today's daily note (link it) |
| A task completed | Kanban board (move to Done), project note (log it), daily note |
| A person note | Daily note (mention interaction), People index if it exists |
| A dev log | Daily note (link it), project note (Recent Activity) |
| A deal update | Side Biz / Deals kanban, Dashboard totals |
| A decision made | Project note (Key Decisions), daily note |
| A mention/shoutout | Mentions Log, person's note, daily note |
| A hook, contrarian angle, or content idea | `social-media/ideas.md` (if folder exists) |
| A specific reusable number or stat | `social-media/data-points.md` (if folder exists) |
| An external post that performed well + why | `social-media/swipe-file.md` (if folder exists) |
| Research findings worth keeping | `social-media/research/YYYY-MM-DD — topic.md` (if folder exists) |
| Any bundle write | operation log (`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if `Logs/` exists, else `log.md`), `index.md` (update if new note created) |

Always propagate. Never create a single orphaned note.

### Bi-temporal facts - never overwrite, always append
When a fact changes (role, company, status, location, tool), NEVER delete the old value. Add a new entry to the `timeline:` frontmatter array with both event time AND transaction time:

```yaml
timeline:
  - fact: "CTO at Single Grain"
    from: 2024-01-01            # event time: when it was true
    until: 2026-04-07
    learned: 2026-02-23         # transaction time: when the vault learned it
    source: "[[2026-02-23]]"    # where from
  - fact: "Architect at Single Grain"
    from: 2026-04-07
    until: present
    learned: 2026-04-07
    source: "[[2026-04-07]]"
```

Top-level fields (`role:`, `status:`, `company:`) always reflect the CURRENT state. The `timeline:` preserves the full history with provenance.

This enables:
- Historical queries ("who was my manager in February?")
- Reflective thinking ("you believed X on Tuesday, then ingested Y on Wednesday and shifted to Z")
- Smart reconciliation (different facts at different times = not a contradiction)
- Full audit trail (when did the vault learn each fact, from what source?)

### CRITICAL_FACTS.md - optional runtime extension
`CRITICAL_FACTS.md` is not part of the core OKF contract. When present, treat it as a small runtime extension file that can hold facts needed in nearly every conversation, such as:
- Timezone
- Current manager
- Current location
- Current company and role
- Any other fact that is true RIGHT NOW and relevant to most interactions

If the file exists, read it after `index.md` and `_CLAUDE.md`. If it does not exist, the bundle is still valid and complete without it.

### Raw is immutable
When a bundle uses a `raw/` folder, treat it as an immutable source area for original materials (articles, transcripts, PDFs). Claude may read these files but should never modify them. If a derived note gets corrupted, re-derive it from the source material. When ingesting, save originals to the bundle's source area (`raw/` if present) and save derived notes to the resolved concept area for that bundle.

### Maintain `index.md` and `log.md`
Two structural files keep the bundle navigable and auditable:

- **`index.md`** - the canonical bundle entrypoint. Claude should read this FIRST when navigating an OKF-first bundle instead of starting from search. Update it whenever a new concept or directory becomes part of the persisted bundle. Format: relative Markdown links grouped by section, for example `- [Project Alpha](./projects/project-alpha.md) - brief description`.

- **`log.md`** - the canonical root operations log. It stays append-only from the perspective of bundle history. In modernized vaults the root file may point to split daily logs under `Logs/`, but the root contract still keeps `log.md` reserved and present.

`_CLAUDE.md`, `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, and similar files can coexist as extensions, but they do not replace `index.md` and `log.md` in the bundle contract.

### Per-day operation logs (modernized bundles)
Bundles initialized with `/obsidian-init` (v0.9+) use a split log structure instead of a monolithic `log.md`:

- **`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** - one file per day, append-only. Format: `**HH:MM** - action | description`
- **`log.md` at bundle root** - pointer file only. Never write entries here; it explains the per-day structure and ships the entry template.

To migrate an existing monolithic `log.md`: run `python scripts/migrate_log.py --vault <path>`.
To refresh the stats block in `index.md` after bulk writes: run `python scripts/vault_stats.py --vault <path>`.

When writing operation log entries, check whether the bundle uses the old (`log.md`) or new (`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) structure and write to the correct location.

### The bundle is a living system
The bundle is not a filing cabinet. It is a living knowledge base that rewrites itself with every input. When new information enters:
- Existing pages get REWRITTEN with new context, not just appended to
- Contradictions between old and new claims get resolved or explicitly documented
- New patterns across multiple sources trigger automatic synthesis pages
- Stale claims get replaced with current information, with history preserved

The bundle after an ingest should be DIFFERENT - not just bigger. If pages that existed before are not smarter, more connected, and more current, the ingest was not deep enough.

### Two-Output Rule
Every interaction that produces insight must generate two outputs:
1. **The answer** - what the user sees in the conversation
2. **A vault update** - the insight filed back into the relevant note(s)

This applies to all thinking tools and any query where Claude synthesizes information from the vault.

### Synthesis Hook
When Claude notices a pattern during any operation (ingest, query, challenge, emerge), it should automatically create a synthesis page in the resolved concepts area (for example `wiki/concepts/` in legacy wiki-style bundles). Patterns include:
- The same concept appearing in 3+ unrelated sources
- A claim being reinforced by multiple independent sources
- A trend emerging across time-sequenced notes
- Two entities sharing unexpected connections

Synthesis pages are the vault thinking for itself - connecting dots the user hasn't connected yet.

### Reconciliation
The vault should never contain two pages that disagree without knowing they disagree. When contradictions are found (during ingest, health checks, or queries), either:
- Resolve them: rewrite the outdated page, preserve history
- Document them: create an explicit conflict page marked as an open question

Use `/obsidian-reconcile` for vault-wide truth maintenance.

### Proactive save reminders
Unsaved conversations are lost knowledge. Claude should proactively remind the user to save:
- After 10+ exchanges: suggest "Want me to run /obsidian-save before we continue?"
- When the user signals wrap-up (e.g., "ok", "thanks", "done", "bye", "that's it"): suggest "Before you go - want me to /obsidian-save this conversation?"
- When a logical work block completes (feature shipped, decision made, problem solved): suggest saving
- Never skip the reminder. This is especially critical on Claude Desktop where there's no background agent.

### Search before creating
Before creating any new note, search for an existing one:
```
search(query="keyword from title")
```
Duplicate notes are vault rot. Merge or update instead of creating new.

### Never claim absence from memory, never fabricate
Two failure modes corrupt the vault silently:
- **False absence (most common):** never say "no note exists" or create a note on the assumption none exists without searching exhaustively first - by every plausible name, alias, and folder, listing and grepping, not from memory. When in doubt, over-include and label the uncertainty.
- **Fabrication:** never invent facts, entities, rates, dates, or relationships that were not actually stated. Mark unknowns as `TBD`; an empty section is correct when nothing was said. External claims carry a source URL + recency marker; inferences carry a confidence level.

See the anti-fabrication and search-completeness hard rules in `references/ai-first-rules.md`.

### Match the vault's voice
Read existing notes in the same folder before writing new ones.
Match: frontmatter schema, heading style, list formatting, tone, emoji usage (or lack of it).
Never introduce new conventions - extend what's already there.

### Frontmatter is mandatory
Every persisted concept note gets YAML frontmatter. At minimum:
```yaml
---
type: concept
date: 2026-03-24
tags:
  - concept
---
```
Root `index.md` also carries `okf_version: "0.1"`. Reserve `index.md` and `log.md` for the root contract and never use them as concept filenames. See `references/vault-schema.md` for full frontmatter specs by note type.

---

## Write Rules

See `references/write-rules.md` for the complete guide. Summary:

- **Links**: Use relative Markdown links as the canonical internal format. Preserve `[[wikilinks]]` only when the surrounding bundle is still Obsidian-native.
- **Dates**: ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in frontmatter. Human format (`March 24`) in body text.
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD - Title.md` for dated notes. `Title.md` for evergreen notes. Reserve `index.md` and `log.md`.
- **Status values**: `active` / `planning` / `completed` / `archived` / `on-hold` for projects. `in-progress` / `done` / `waiting` for tasks.
- **Kanban**: Items may still use Obsidian-friendly notation inside extension folders, but persisted concept links should remain readable as standard Markdown where practical.

---

## The `_CLAUDE.md` File

`_CLAUDE.md` is an extension file, not part of the core OKF bundle contract.

When it exists at the bundle root, it can persist local operating rules across sessions and surfaces (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, terminal). Typical uses:
- folder-map refinements
- frontmatter details beyond the base OKF contract
- local auto-save behavior
- privacy or workflow rules specific to one vault

**Precedence rule:** for bundle validity and navigation, `index.md` and `log.md` define the core contract. For local runtime behavior, `_CLAUDE.md` may refine those defaults without becoming a required part of the persisted knowledge format.

**What it usually contains:**
- local folder map and what each folder is for
- additional frontmatter conventions for the fork
- naming conventions beyond the core contract
- what to auto-save vs. what to ask first
- people and projects that need special handling
- links to key files (boards, dashboard, templates)

To generate a `_CLAUDE.md` for an existing vault, run vault discovery and use the template in `references/claude-md-template.md`.

## Common Operations

### Save info from conversation
When a conversation produces something worth persisting in the bundle:
1. Identify the note type (decision -> project or decision note, person met -> resolved people area, task -> board + resolved tasks area, etc.)
2. Check if a relevant note already exists
3. Write or update - always frontmatter-first
4. Propagate to boards, daily note, linked notes

### Create today's daily note
```
date = today in YYYY-MM-DD format
path = <resolved daily notes area>/{date}.md
```
Read `Templates/Daily Note.md`, fill in the date fields, create the file.
Then scan recent conversation for anything worth logging in today's sections.

### Log a dev session
Read `Templates/Dev Log.md`. Fill: date, project name, what was worked on, problems solved, decisions made, next steps.
Save to the resolved dev logs area using a dated project filename such as `YYYY-MM-DD - Project Name.md`.
Link from project note's Recent Activity section and today's daily note.

### Update a kanban board
Boards use the `kanban-plugin: board` frontmatter.
Columns are `## Column Name` headers.
Items are `- [ ] **Title** @{due-date}
	Description [Related note](../path/to/note.md)`; preserve `[[wikilinks]]` only when the surrounding board is explicitly Obsidian-native.
Completed items move to the `## ✅ Done` column with a strikethrough: `- [x] ~~**Title**~~ ✅ Date`

### Run vault health check
```bash
python scripts/vault_health.py --path ~/path/to/vault
```
Reports: duplicate notes, orphaned files (no incoming links), stale tasks (overdue), empty folders, broken links, notes missing frontmatter.

Proactively suggest running this when the user says the vault feels messy, notes are hard to find, they mention duplicates, or they haven't mentioned a health check in a long time. Offer: *"Want me to run a vault health check?"*

---

## Commands

These slash commands can be used in any Claude surface. Each one is smart - it reads context, searches before writing, and propagates everywhere changes belong.

**Name matching:** If a name argument has a typo or is approximate, search the vault for the closest match, show what was found, and confirm with the user before proceeding. Never silently create a note with a misspelled name.

---

### `/obsidian-save`

**The master save command.** Reads the entire conversation and extracts everything worth preserving.

Steps:
1. Scan the conversation and identify all vault-worthy items: decisions, tasks, people mentioned, projects started, ideas, learnings, deals, mentions/shoutouts
2. Group items by type: people, projects, tasks, decisions, ideas, deals
3. Spawn parallel subagents - one per group - so all note types are handled simultaneously:
   - **People agent**: search for each person, create or update notes, log interactions
   - **Projects agent**: search for each project, create or update notes
   - **Tasks agent**: parse tasks, add to the right kanban columns
   - **Decisions agent**: find relevant project notes, append to Key Decisions sections
   - **Ideas agent**: search the resolved ideas or incubation area for related notes, create or append
4. After all agents complete: update today's daily note with links to everything saved
5. Report back: a clean list of what was saved and where

Do not ask for guidance on where to save things - infer it. Only ask if something is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. a person mentioned with no context on who they are).

---

### `/obsidian-daily`

**Creates or updates today's daily note.**

Steps:
1. Check whether today's daily note already exists in the resolved daily notes area
2. If not: read `Templates/Daily Note.md`, fill in date fields, create the file
3. Scan the current conversation for anything relevant to today: tasks in progress, people mentioned, decisions made, what's being worked on
4. Pre-fill or update the note's sections with that context
5. If the note already exists, inject new content into the right sections rather than overwriting

Return the path of the daily note when done.

---

### `/obsidian-calendar <mode>`

**One calendar command with four modes.** Claude Code only (needs the Google Calendar MCP). The first word selects the mode; a bare range word defaults to `agenda`; no argument at all defaults to `agenda today`.

- **`agenda [range]`** - reads the calendar and writes a re-derivable AI-first snapshot to the resolved agenda area (for example `wiki/agenda/` in legacy wiki-style bundles) with `type: agenda-snapshot`. Range: `today`, `tomorrow`, `week`, `next-week`, a date, or a range. Cross-links attendees to person notes using the bundle's canonical internal link format; flags conflicts, 3+ back-to-back stretches, working-hours focus blocks, and externally-organized events. Read-only on the calendar; Google Calendar stays the source of truth.
- **`reconcile [window]`** - flags commitments the vault implies (project `next_action`s, due tasks, dated commitments in daily notes, fixed dates in `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`) that are NOT on the calendar, plus events with no vault context. Flag only - never adds or changes events.
- **`meeting [selector]`** - turns an event (`last`, `next`, `today`, `event-id:<id>`, or fuzzy title) into a `type: meeting` note in the resolved meetings area (for example `wiki/meetings/` in legacy wiki-style bundles) with metadata pre-filled and **empty** Notes / Decisions / Action items sections (never fabricate meeting content). Cross-links attendees and backlinks any task whose `calendar-event-id` matches.
- **`schedule <args>`** - the only mode that writes to the calendar. Standalone (`"<title>" <when> <duration>`), from a task (`task:<path>`), or suggest-a-time (`task:<...> suggest:<window>`). Resolves attendee emails from person notes (never guesses), conflict-checks before writing, requests a Meet link when participants span domains, and writes `calendar-event-id` back into the task so a re-run reschedules rather than duplicating.

(Consolidated from the former `/obsidian-agenda`, `/obsidian-reconcile`-style calendar check, `/obsidian-meeting`, and `/obsidian-schedule` - same behaviors, one entry point. The natural-language triggers for all four still route here.)

---

### `/obsidian-recurring`

**Tracks a recurring obligation (payment, filing, ops) with a cadence and a computed next-due date.**

State the obligation and cadence (e.g. "pay social benefits, monthly day 20"). Searches for an existing note first, then builds a `type: recurring-task` note with What / Cadence / Blockers / History sections and frontmatter (`cadence`, `owner`, `blocker`, `next-due`, optional `amount`). Adds a board card for the next occurrence; on each completion, appends a History row and advances `next-due`. Fills the gap that `/obsidian-task` (one-shot) leaves.

---

### `/obsidian-log`

**Logs a work or dev session to the vault.**

Steps:
1. Infer the project from conversation context - search the vault if needed to find the right project note
2. Read `Templates/Dev Log.md` (or `Templates/Work Log.md` if it exists)
3. Fill in: date, project, what was worked on, problems encountered, decisions made, next steps - all inferred from the conversation
4. Save to `Dev Logs/YYYY-MM-DD — Project Name.md`
5. Inject a link into the project note's Recent Activity section
6. Inject a link into today's daily note Work section

---

### `/obsidian-task [description]`

**Adds a task to the vault and the right kanban board.**

Steps:
1. Parse the task from the argument or from recent conversation context if no argument given
2. Infer: priority (🔴/🟡/🟢), due date, linked project, linked person
3. Search for the right kanban board - use the board map from `_CLAUDE.md` when present, otherwise resolve it from the existing bundle layout
4. Add the task card to the correct column (`📋 This Week` or `📥 Backlog` depending on due date)
5. Create a task note in `Tasks/` if the task is substantial (more than a one-liner)
6. Link the task from the relevant project note and today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-person [name]`

**Creates or updates a person note.**

Steps:
1. Search the vault for an existing note matching the name (fuzzy - handle typos and partial names)
2. If found: confirm with user, then update with new info from conversation
3. If not found: create a person note in the resolved people area with the full frontmatter schema
4. Fill in everything inferable from the conversation: role, company, context, relationship strength, last interaction date
5. Log the interaction in today's daily note
6. If a People index file exists, add or update the entry there

---

### `/obsidian-capture [optional: idea text]`

**Quick idea capture with zero friction.**

Steps:
1. Take the argument as the idea, or pull the most recent idea/thought from the conversation
2. Search the resolved ideas area for a related existing note - if found, append to it
3. If new: create a note in the resolved ideas area with minimal frontmatter (`date`, `tags: [idea]`)
4. Write the idea with any supporting context from the conversation
5. Add a brief mention in today's daily note under an Ideas or Captures section

---

### `/obsidian-catchup [today|week|all]`

**Process what the Telegram journal bot captured on the go.** The laptop-side companion to the `integrations/telegram-journal/` bot, which captures voice/text/image/PDF/link from your phone and appends each to a `catchup.md` queue in the vault.

Steps:
1. Read `catchup.md` in the vault root - each unchecked `- [ ]` line is an unprocessed capture (`date time | kind | summary | -> where`).
2. Collect the unchecked items, applying the timeframe filter (`today` / `week` / `all`, default `all`). If none, say so and stop.
3. Show them grouped by age (Today / This week / Older), flagging stale ones.
4. Process WITH the user (not autonomously): open each linked note, propose **integrate** (fold into the right note per the AI-first rule) / **keep** / **discard**, confirm, then write.
5. Check the item off (`- [x]` + processed date); never delete queue history.

Pull, not push: nothing is processed until you run this, so nothing surprises you. The phone is for fast dumb capture; this is where it becomes integrated knowledge.

---

### `/obsidian-find [query]`

**Smart vault search.**

Steps:
1. Run `search(query="...")` with the provided query
2. Also try variations if results are sparse (synonyms, related terms)
3. Return results with context: note title, folder, a relevant excerpt, and what type of note it is
4. If results are ambiguous, group them by type (people, projects, tasks, etc.)
5. Offer to open, update, or link any of the found notes

Do not just return filenames - return enough context for the user to act.

---

### `/obsidian-recap [today|week|month]`

**Summarizes a time period from the vault.**

Steps:
1. Determine the date range from the argument (default: `week` if not specified)
2. List all daily notes in the resolved daily-notes area for the range
3. Spawn parallel subagents - one per daily note - to read and extract key points from each simultaneously
4. Also spawn parallel agents to read dev logs and completed kanban tasks from the same period
5. Synthesize all agent results: what was worked on, decisions made, people interacted with, tasks completed, ideas captured
6. Present as a clean narrative summary - not a raw dump of note content

---

### `/obsidian-review`

**Generates a structured weekly or monthly review note.**

Steps:
1. Ask: weekly or monthly? (or infer from context)
2. Read daily notes and dev logs for the period
3. Read active projects and check for status changes
4. Read completed tasks from kanban boards
5. Draft a review note using `Templates/Review.md` if it exists, otherwise use a standard structure:
   - What I accomplished
   - Key decisions made
   - People I worked with
   - What I learned
   - What to carry forward
6. Save to `Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD — Weekly Review.md` (or Monthly)
7. Link from the last daily note of the period

---

### `/obsidian-board [optional: board name]`

**Shows or updates a kanban board.**

Steps:
1. If a board name is given, search the resolved boards area for it (fuzzy match)
2. If no name given, list available boards and ask which one
3. Read and display the current board state: columns, item counts, overdue items (past `@{date}`)
4. Ask if the user wants to make updates - if yes, infer changes from conversation context
5. Move completed items to ✅ Done with strikethrough, add new items in the right column
6. Flag any items that are overdue or have been in the same column for more than a week

---

### `/obsidian-board-hygiene [optional: board name]`

**Bulk-triages a kanban board whose columns have gone stale.** Where `/obsidian-board` only flags overdue items, this clears them.

Steps:
1. Read `index.md` first, then `_CLAUDE.md` if present, to resolve the boards area and kanban convention (columns, `@{date}` format)
2. Read the target board (fuzzy-match; if none given, list boards and ask), parse every open item, compute age vs today
3. Group items into overdue (`@{date}` past), stale (older than N days, default 14), and undated; show counts per column so the bloat is visible
4. Propose ONE verdict per stale/overdue item with a one-line reason - done / reschedule / archive / keep - as a batch the user approves, edits, or overrides
5. Apply approved verdicts in place (additive moves + strikethrough, never silent deletion), then report what moved and log it

---

### `/obsidian-project [name]`

**Creates or updates a project note.**

Steps:
1. Search the vault for an existing project matching the name (fuzzy - handle typos)
2. If found: show what was found, confirm, then update with new info from conversation
3. If not found: create a project note in the resolved projects area with the full frontmatter schema (`date`, `tags: [project]`, `status: active`, `job`)
4. Fill in everything inferable from the conversation: description, goals, key people, current status
5. Add a card to the relevant kanban board in the `📥 Backlog` or `🔨 In Progress` column
6. Link from today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-projects [optional: project name]`

**Live status overview across all tracked projects.**

Resolves the projects area from `index.md` and optional extension files, then scans it for notes with `type: project` or a `repo:` field. For each project, spawns a parallel subagent that runs three checks: reads the vault note (status, last activity, next action, blockers), runs `git log` and `git status` if a `repo:` path is set, and looks for `NOTES.md` / `TODO.md` in the repo root. Merges the three into one status block (active / stalled / idle / blocked / archived inferred from activity recency), prints the full overview to the conversation ordered active-first, then injects a `## Last overview` section into each project note.

If a project name argument is given, shows deep context for that one project only.

---

### `/obsidian-health`

**Runs a vault health check and summarizes findings.**

Steps:
1. Run: `python scripts/vault_health.py --path ~/path/to/vault --json`
2. Parse the JSON output and split findings into categories
3. Spawn parallel subagents to handle each category simultaneously:
   - **Links agent**: verify broken links, attempt to resolve them
   - **Duplicates agent**: confirm duplicates are truly the same concept, not just similar names
   - **Frontmatter agent**: identify notes missing required fields by type
   - **Staleness agent**: check overdue tasks and unfilled template syntax
   - **Orphans agent**: check orphaned notes and empty folders
   - **Contradictions agent**: scan Key Decisions and the resolved knowledge/concepts area for claims that conflict or are superseded
   - **Concept gaps agent**: find terms mentioned 3+ times without a dedicated page
   - **Stale claims agent**: flag knowledge notes older than 6 months on fast-moving topics in the resolved knowledge area
4. Merge agent results and group by severity:
   - 🔴 Critical: broken links, unfilled template syntax, contradictions
   - 🟡 Warning: duplicates, stale tasks, missing frontmatter, stale claims, concept gaps
   - ⚪ Info: orphaned notes, empty folders
5. Present a clean summary with counts per category
6. For safe fixes (missing frontmatter, obvious duplicates, creating pages for concept gaps), offer to fix them automatically
7. For destructive fixes (archiving, merging, resolving contradictions), list them and ask for explicit confirmation before touching anything
8. Append to `log.md` with severity counts

---

### `/obsidian-retrieval-eval [optional: N to generate | report]`

**Measures how well vault search actually finds the right note - so improving retrieval is a number, not a hunch.**

Hybrid command backed by `scripts/eval/retrieval_eval.py`, which reuses the REAL search engine (`integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/vault_ops.py`, the term-frequency, title-weighted ranking behind `/obsidian-find` and the MCP connector). It bootstraps its own eval set from the vault (an LLM writes a question per sampled note, avoiding the note's title words so it tests retrieval not string-match; the note is the gold answer), then scores recall@1/3/5/10 and MRR and lists the failures - misses and notes buried below #3, naming which note wrongly ranked #1. Claude interprets the numbers, turns failures into ranked retrieval fixes (each a hypothesis to re-measure on the same cases), and optionally writes an AI-first baseline note. Generated cases hold private note paths and are gitignored. The first run on a 1,000+ note vault scored **0% recall@10** on paraphrased questions (long `raw/` transcripts and `log.md` dominate term-frequency ranking) - proving the cheap structural fixes (exclude `raw/`, weight by `type:`) should be measured before reaching for a vector index.

---

### `/obsidian-reconcile`

**Finds and resolves contradictions across the vault.**

Steps:
1. Read `index.md` to understand the full vault landscape
2. Spawn parallel subagents to find contradictions:
   - **Claims agent**: scan the resolved concepts and projects areas for conflicting factual claims
   - **Entity agent**: scan `wiki/entities/` for outdated roles, companies, or descriptions
   - **Decisions agent**: scan `wiki/decisions/` for reversed or superseded decisions never updated
   - **Source freshness agent**: compare `raw/` dates against `wiki/` pages for stale references
3. For each contradiction, evaluate: which is newer, which is more authoritative, is it a genuine conflict or an evolution
4. Resolve:
   - **Clear winner**: rewrite the outdated page, add a History section noting what changed
   - **Ambiguous**: create `wiki/decisions/Conflict — Topic.md` with both sides, mark `status: open`
   - **Evolution**: update the page to current state with historical context
5. Rebuild affected `index.md` sections, append to `log.md`, update daily note

---

### `/obsidian-synthesize`

**Automatic synthesis - the vault thinks for itself.**

Can run manually or as a scheduled agent. Scans the vault for patterns nobody asked about.

Steps:
1. Read `index.md` and `log.md` (last 20 entries) for recent activity
2. Spawn parallel subagents:
   - **Cross-source agent**: find concepts appearing in 2+ unrelated sources from the last 7 days
   - **Entity convergence agent**: find people who appear together in multiple contexts but have no connection page
   - **Concept evolution agent**: find concepts updated 3+ times and document how thinking changed
   - **Orphan rescue agent**: find unlinked notes that should be connected to existing pages
3. For each pattern: create a synthesis note in the resolved concepts area with evidence, interpretation, and suggested action
4. Link synthesis pages FROM all source notes they reference
5. Update `index.md`, `log.md`, and today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-export`

**Export a clean snapshot any agent or tool can consume.**

Steps:
1. Scan all persisted bundle notes and extract: path, title, type, date, status, summary, links, tags, frontmatter
2. Output as JSON (default) to `_export/vault-snapshot.json` or markdown to `_export/vault-snapshot.md`
3. The snapshot is a flat, structured representation of the vault - no folder structure knowledge needed
4. Any AI tool, automation, or agent can read this file and understand the vault
5. Append to `log.md`

---

### `/obsidian-init`

**Bootstraps `_CLAUDE.md` for the bundle - an optional operating-manual extension.**

Steps:
1. Glob the bundle root (`<vault>/**/*.md`) to map the full structure
2. Spawn parallel subagents to discover bundle context simultaneously:
   - **Dashboard agent**: read `Home.md` or equivalent dashboard
   - **Templates agent**: read all files in `Templates/`
   - **Boards agent**: read all files in the resolved boards area
   - **Samples agent**: read one existing note per major folder to capture naming conventions and frontmatter patterns
3. Merge all agent results into a complete picture of the bundle
4. Generate a complete `_CLAUDE.md` using the template in `references/claude-md-template.md`, filled with real values from the bundle
5. Write it to `_CLAUDE.md` at the bundle root (Write tool, or `obsidian_save_note` if using the bundled MCP server)
6. Confirm what was written and tell the user to restart their Claude session so the new file takes effect

If `_CLAUDE.md` already exists: show a diff of what would change and ask before overwriting.

---

### `/obsidian-architect`

**Scans a codebase and writes a maintained set of architecture notes into the vault - overview, per-module notes, key decisions. Re-runnable.**

Hybrid command: `scripts/architect_scan.py` does a deterministic scan (stack, modules, dependencies, entry points, git commit) and emits JSON; Claude synthesizes the prose, rationale, a Mermaid diagram, and likely personas, then writes AI-first notes under the resolved project architecture area (for example `Projects/<name>/Architecture/`) with `type: architecture-overview` and `type: architecture-module`. Pulls decision candidates from `scripts/mine_commit_decisions.py`. Refresh is the same command re-run: it uses sentinel markers (`<!-- @generated -->` / `<!-- @user -->`, see `references/write-rules.md`) so re-running updates only the generated blocks and never clobbers your hand-edits. For builders who want their code projects documented in the same brain as their ideas and decisions.

---

### `/obsidian-visualize [scope]`

**Generates a JSON Canvas map of the vault's knowledge graph, openable in Obsidian's native canvas viewer.**

Backed by `scripts/link_graph.py` (deterministic link extraction - no whole-vault read). Optional scope: a project, entity, topic, or `full` (default). Builds nodes and edges from `[[wikilinks]]`, clusters by type (entities, projects, concepts, daily, sources) with color and size keyed to centrality, flags orphans with a red border, and writes `atlas.canvas` (or `atlas-<topic>.canvas`) to the vault root. Also emits a text summary: hub nodes by degree centrality, bridge nodes, stale orphans, clusters, and any centrality skew (a single navigation point of failure). Appends a one-line entry to the operation log.

---

### `/create-command [seed]`

**Scaffolds a new obsidian-second-brain command through a short interview - no markdown or frontmatter editing.**

A guided conversation (intent, name, category, trigger phrases, behavior steps, AI-first compliance, external APIs) writes a fully-formed `commands/<name>.md` that the build pipeline picks up on the next `bash scripts/build.sh`, flowing into all six platform builds. The optional seed pre-fills suggestions. Every command created this way lands AI-first-compliant by construction. (This is the command that creates commands; it does not run on itself.)

---

### `/obsidian-ingest`

**Ingests a source into the vault - one source touches many pages.**

Steps:
1. Accept a URL, file path, or pasted text as the source
2. Classify the source type before full read: article, PDF, transcript, video, or raw text
3. Read or fetch the full source content
4. Extract: entities (people, companies, tools), concepts, claims, action items, notable quotes
5. Save the source note to the resolved knowledge or source area with full summary and source link
6. Spawn parallel subagents to distribute knowledge across the vault:
   - **People agent**: create or update person notes for each person mentioned in the resolved people area
   - **Projects agent**: update existing project notes with new findings
   - **Ideas agent**: create or append to the resolved ideas or incubation area for new concepts
   - **Knowledge agent**: create or update knowledge notes for factual claims and frameworks in the resolved knowledge area
7. Update `index.md` with all newly created notes
8. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title (type) — X created, Y updated`
9. Update today's daily note with an ingest summary

A single ingest should touch 5-15 files. Compile knowledge once, distribute everywhere.

---

## Thinking Tools

These commands use the vault as a thinking partner - not just storage. They surface insights, challenge assumptions, and generate connections that the user cannot see on their own.

---

### `/obsidian-challenge`

**Red-teams your current idea against your own vault history.**

Steps:
1. Identify the user's current claim, plan, or assumption - from the argument or conversation context
2. Extract the key premises behind that position
3. Spawn parallel subagents to search for counter-evidence:
   - **Decisions agent**: search Key Decisions sections for past decisions that contradicted similar thinking
   - **Failures agent**: search dev logs, daily notes, and archives for past failures or lessons related to this topic
   - **Contradictions agent**: search for notes where the user held the opposite position or flagged risks
4. Synthesize a structured "Red Team" analysis:
   - **Your position**: restate the claim
   - **Counter-evidence from your vault**: cite specific notes, dates, and quotes
   - **Blind spots**: what the user might be ignoring based on their own history
   - **Verdict**: consistent with past experience, or does the vault suggest caution?
5. Log the challenge in today's daily note under a Thinking section

Do not be agreeable. The entire point is to pressure-test. Cite specific vault files.

---

### `/obsidian-emerge`

**Surfaces unnamed patterns from recent notes - recurring themes and conclusions you haven't explicitly stated.**

Steps:
1. Determine the date range from the argument (default: last 30 days)
2. Spawn parallel subagents to scan vault content:
   - **Daily notes agent**: extract recurring topics, complaints, observations, energy patterns
   - **Dev logs agent**: extract repeated blockers, tools, architectural patterns
   - **Decisions agent**: look for directional trends across project notes
   - **Ideas agent**: look for thematic clusters in notes from the resolved ideas or incubation area
3. Identify:
   - **Recurring themes**: topics that appeared 3+ times without being named as a priority
   - **Emotional patterns**: what energizes vs. drains (based on language)
   - **Unnamed conclusions**: things the notes imply but never state outright
   - **Emerging directions**: where the vault suggests the user is heading
4. Present a "Pattern Report" - each pattern with evidence (cited notes), interpretation, and suggested action
5. Offer to save the report to the resolved ideas or incubation area, or to a relevant project note
6. Log a summary in today's daily note

The goal is insight the user cannot see themselves. Surface what they haven't named yet.

---

### `/obsidian-connect [topic A] [topic B]`

**Bridges two unrelated domains using the vault's link graph to spark new ideas.**

Steps:
1. Parse two domains from arguments (e.g., `/obsidian-connect "distributed systems" "cooking"`)
2. For each domain, search the vault: find all related notes, map backlinks and outgoing links to build a local cluster
3. Find the bridge:
   - Shared links, tags, or people between the two clusters
   - If a direct path exists in the link graph, trace it and explain each hop
   - If no direct path, find the closest semantic overlap
4. Generate creative connections:
   - **Structural analogy**: how a pattern in A maps to B
   - **Transfer opportunities**: what works in A that could apply to B
   - **Collision ideas**: new concepts that only exist at the intersection
5. Present 3-5 specific, actionable connections - not vague analogies but concrete ideas
6. Offer to save the best connections to the resolved ideas or incubation area with links to both source domains
7. Log the connection exercise in today's daily note

The value is in unexpected links. If the connection is obvious, dig deeper.

---

### `/obsidian-graduate`

**Promotes an idea fragment into a full project spec with tasks, board entries, and structure.**

Steps:
1. If an argument is given: search the resolved ideas or incubation area, daily notes, and captures for a matching idea (fuzzy)
2. If no argument: list recent ideas (last 14 days) and ask the user to pick one
3. Read the full idea note and any linked notes for context
4. Research the vault for related content: overlapping projects, related people, past decisions, similar ideas explored before
5. Generate a full project spec:
   - **Project note** in the resolved projects area with complete frontmatter (status: planning, linked idea)
   - **Goals**: 3-5 concrete outcomes
   - **Key tasks**: broken into phases with priorities
   - **Open questions**: what still needs answering
   - **Related notes**: links to everything relevant
6. Add cards to the relevant kanban board
7. Update the original idea note: add `status: graduated` and link to the new project
8. Link the new project from today's daily note

The idea doesn't die - it evolves. The original note stays as the origin story.

---

### `/obsidian-panel`

**Convenes a panel of distinct perspectives on a decision - one independent verdict per lens, then a synthesis.**

A multi-persona complement to `/obsidian-challenge` (which red-teams from one stance). Uses the vault's `Advisors/` persona notes as panelists if they exist, otherwise four generic lenses (skeptic, user, operator, long-game). Each panelist argues independently before the synthesis; the disagreement is the point and is never hidden. Saves a `type: synthesis` note to the resolved concepts area.

---

### `/vault-deep-synthesis [topic]`

**Cross-references everything the vault knows about one topic: agreements, contradictions, stale claims, coverage gaps.**

Topic-driven (unlike `/obsidian-synthesize`, which scans the whole vault unprompted). Pure vault, no network. Greps and reads every note touching the topic, then consolidates into what the vault agrees on, where notes contradict (surfaced, not resolved - that is `/obsidian-reconcile`), what looks stale, and what is missing. Saves a `type: synthesis` note; never modifies the sources.

---

### `/obsidian-distill [note or source]`

**Condenses one source into key claims, each tagged with provenance back to the exact block it came from.** A distillation, not a summary: condensed enough to read fast, anchored enough to audit.

Segments the source into numbered, citable blocks (`B1`, `B2`, ...), extracts the key claims, and tags each claim with the block(s) it came from (`(src: B3)`). A claim with no traceable source does not make the cut - and gets reported as dropped, never silently cut. Inferences the source implies but never states go in a separate labelled section so distilled fact and reasoning never blur. Saves a `type: distillation` note (with the verbatim `source` and the numbered source blocks at the bottom), links it from the original. This is the trust primitive for a vault more than one person reads - the differentiator behind the team-vault direction. Pairs with `/obsidian-ingest` (brings the source in) and `/vault-deep-synthesis` (cross-references many notes).

---

### `/idea-discovery`

**Ranks 3-5 next-direction candidates from ungraduated ideas, open project questions, and orphan research.**

Answers "what is worth doing next" from vault material. Distinct from `/obsidian-emerge` (names unstated patterns) and `/obsidian-graduate` (promotes one chosen idea). Ranks candidates by a stated heuristic (recency, pull, momentum) and gives the smallest next step for each. Does not auto-graduate.

---

### `/obsidian-learn [recent|all|topic]`

**Reviews the lessons scattered across the vault and turns them into a living rulebook.**

Scans daily notes, dev logs, ADRs, and auto-generated pattern reports for lessons, mistakes, and wins, then classifies each as active, stale, superseded, or a promotion candidate (appeared 3+ times - worth becoming a permanent rule in `_CLAUDE.md`). Default scope is the last 30 days (`all` for the whole vault, or a named topic). Writes a Learnings Review to the resolved concepts area and offers to promote candidates or archive stale lessons with confirmation. Lessons that are not reviewed do not compound.

---

## Context Engine

### `/obsidian-world`

**Loads your identity, values, priorities, and current state in one shot - with progressive context levels.**

Uses token budgets to avoid loading the entire vault. Start light, go deeper only as needed.

Steps:
1. **L0 - Identity (~200 tokens)**: read `SOUL.md`/`About Me.md` and `CORE_VALUES.md`/`Values.md`
2. **L1 - Navigation (~1-2K tokens)**: read `index.md` (vault catalog) and `log.md` (last 10 entries)
3. **L2 - Current State (~2-5K tokens)**: read `Home.md`/`Dashboard.md`, today's daily note, last 3 daily notes, active kanban boards, previous session digests
4. **L3 - Deep Context (on demand, ~5-20K tokens)**: only load if needed - active project notes, full knowledge articles from the resolved knowledge area, recently mentioned people

Present a brief status after L0-L2 (do NOT load L3 unless needed):
- **Who I am to you**: persona and communication style
- **Your current priorities**: top 3-5 active threads (from index.md + boards)
- **Open threads from last session**: anything unfinished (from log.md + daily notes)
- **Overdue / needs attention**: stale tasks or projects
- **Today so far**: what's already logged

Keep output concise - this is a boot-up sequence, not a report.

If identity files don't exist, offer to create them by asking 5-7 quick questions about the user's role, values, and preferences.
If `index.md` doesn't exist, offer to run `/obsidian-init` to generate it.

---

### `/obsidian-decide [topic] [--formal]`

**Records decisions at two depths.** Default mode captures the decisions made in a conversation as dated one-liners appended to the relevant project notes' `## Key Decisions` sections (and the daily note) - for the steady stream of choices made while working. `--formal` (or leading with `adr`) instead writes one full Architecture Decision Record - Decision / Context / Options Considered / Rationale / Consequences / Related - to the decisions folder (resolved per `references/folder-map.md`: wiki-style `wiki/decisions/`, Obsidian-style `Knowledge/`), links it from the project's Key Decisions and `index.md`, and logs it. Use the formal mode for a structural or directional decision worth a real writeup; `python scripts/mine_commit_decisions.py` surfaces decision-shaped commits as ADR candidates.

The vault knows why it's structured the way it is - when a future session asks "why?", the formal record answers. `/obsidian-graduate`, `/obsidian-health` structural fixes, and folder reorganizations may offer to write a formal record; they offer, they don't force.

(Consolidated: the former standalone `/obsidian-adr` is now `/obsidian-decide --formal`; its triggers still route here.)

---

## Research Commands

Eight commands that pull external knowledge into the vault - X posts, X discourse, web research with citations, vault-grounded synthesis, opt-in personal NotebookLM imports, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes (plus `/obsidian-ingest` above for arbitrary URLs, PDFs, audio, and screenshots). All output AI-first notes per the vault's Section 0 rule (preamble, rich frontmatter, recency markers, canonical relative Markdown links, sources verbatim).

**Setup:** API keys live at `~/.config/obsidian-second-brain/.env`. Run `install.sh` and answer "y" to the research toolkit prompt, or copy `.env.example` manually. xAI Grok and Perplexity keys are required; YouTube key is optional (transcripts work without it).

**Stack:** Python 3.10+ with `uv`. Install deps via `uv sync` from the repo root.

---

### `/x-read [url]`

**Deep-read an X post** via Grok + Live Search. Verbatim post + thread + TL;DR + key claims + reply sentiment + voices to watch.

Steps:
1. Validate the URL contains `x.com/` or `twitter.com/`
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.x_read "<url>"` from the repo root
3. Show the structured analysis verbatim to the user
4. **Default save: chat only.** If the user asks "save this", write an AI-first note to `Research/X-reads/`

Plain English triggers: "read this tweet", "analyze this X post", "what's in this tweet".

---

### `/x-pulse [topic]`

**Scan X for what's trending** in a topic. Themes (with rep posts + voices), gaps, hooks working, voice/tone, post ideas.

Steps:
1. Resolve the topic (multi-word fine)
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.x_pulse "<topic>"`
3. Show the pulse output verbatim
4. **Default save: auto-saves** to `Research/X-pulse/YYYY-MM-DD — <slug>.md` (AI-first format)
5. Append one-line entry to `log.md`

Plain English: "what's hot on X about AI", "X pulse on vibe coding", "what should I post today on AI automation".

---

### `/research [topic]`

**Web research with citations** via Perplexity Sonar Pro. Deep dossier: summary, key facts (with recency markers), timeline, key players, contrarian views, further reading, open questions.

Steps:
1. Resolve the topic
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.research "<topic>"`
3. Show the dossier verbatim, including citations
4. **Default save: auto-saves** to `Research/Web/YYYY-MM-DD — <slug>.md`
5. All citations stored in frontmatter for later Dataview queries

Plain English: "research X", "look up X", "find me info on X". Note: "do deep research" routes to `/research-deep` instead.

---

### `/research-deep [topic]`

**Vault-first deep research with cross-vault propagation.** The chain-everything command.

Steps (4 phases):
1. **Vault scan** - find existing notes mentioning the topic (the baseline)
2. **Gap analysis** - Perplexity sonar-pro identifies what's missing/stale, emits 3-5 targeted queries
3. **Gap-fill** - runs each query via Perplexity (web) or Grok+Live Search (X)
4. **Synthesis** - Perplexity sonar-deep-research produces a delta report (what's new, what's confirmed, contradictions, recommended vault updates, open questions)

Then:
- Writes synthesis to `Research/Deep/YYYY-MM-DD — <slug>.md`
- Emits a JSON propagation payload between `<<<RESEARCH_DEEP_PROPAGATION_PAYLOAD>>>` markers
- Calling Claude reads that payload and runs `/obsidian-save`-style propagation: spawns parallel subagents to update people, projects, ideas, and decisions in their resolved bundle areas per the synthesis's "Recommended Vault Updates" bullets
- Links new research note from today's daily note

Cost: typically $0.20-$0.80 per run depending on topic depth.

Plain English: "do deep research on X", "research properly", "vault-aware research on X", "research and update the vault".

Graceful degradation: if any phase fails partially (e.g. Grok unavailable), continues with available sources and flags the gap.

---

### `/notebooklm [topic]`

**Vault-first source-grounded research.** The parallel to `/research-deep` - but grounded in your own sources instead of the open web.

Steps (4 phases + manual NotebookLM step):
1. **Vault scan** - same logic as `/research-deep` Phase 1, finds top 12 most relevant notes
2. **Bundle** - concatenates them into a single markdown source file at `Research/NotebookLM/YYYY-MM-DD — <slug> — bundle.md` (well under NotebookLM's 500K-char/source limit)
3. **Prompt template** - script prints a structured prompt with sections: Source summary / Confirmed claims / Contradictions / Gaps / Recommended next reads / Confidence
4. **User does the manual NotebookLM step:** open notebooklm.google.com, create a notebook, paste the bundle as a "Pasted Text" source, optionally add PDFs/URLs/Google Docs, paste the prompt, copy the response
5. **Save response** - user runs `uv run -m scripts.research.notebooklm --save-response --topic "<topic>" --slug "<slug>"` and pastes response via stdin
6. **Propagation** - same `/obsidian-save` flow as `/research-deep`

When to use `/notebooklm` over `/research-deep`:
- `/research-deep` (Perplexity + Grok): open-web + X-discourse coverage. Cost: $0.20-0.80
- `/notebooklm`: GROUNDED IN your own sources (vault + any PDFs/URLs you add). Cost: ~$0 (uses your free NotebookLM access)
- Run both for high-value topics - the open-web view and the grounded view rarely contradict, and the contradictions are where the insight is

Why a manual step: NotebookLM's API is workspace-gated beta as of 2026-01. The pasted-source workflow works for every user with a free Google account.

Plain English: "notebooklm this", "ask my notebook about X", "ground a research on X using my vault", "source-grounded research on X".

---

### `/notebooklm-import`

**Opt-in import of a personal NotebookLM notebook into an OKF bundle.** This is distinct from `/notebooklm`: it uses the local personal NotebookLM session rather than creating a vault-grounded research prompt.

Steps:
1. Confirm the notebook and the destination `.md` path inside the bundle.
2. Confirm `notebooklm-to-notes` and the local personal NotebookLM authentication are available. Never run this flow in CI, scheduled jobs, or shared-cookie environments.
3. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.notebooklm_import --notebook "<id>" --destination "<folder>/<file>.md"`.
4. The importer stages the export, validates UTF-8, `type`, provenance, editorial sections, Mermaid and compatible links before writing.
5. Report the saved note, relative `index.md` entry, `log.md` record and preserved sources. Apply `/obsidian-save` only for real relationships.

Plain English: "import my NotebookLM notebook", "bring my NotebookLM notebook into the vault", "importar notebook do NotebookLM".

### `/youtube [url] [--visual]`

**Extract and summarize a YouTube video.** Transcript (free, no API key) + metadata + top comments (Data API v3, optional) → summarized via Grok. Add `--visual` to also *watch* the video: scene-change frame extraction Claude reads with its own vision.

Steps:
1. Parse video ID from URL or 11-char ID
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.youtube_extract "<url>"` (add `--visual` for the frame layer, `--max-frames N` to cap frames read, default 24)
3. Fetches transcript via `youtube-transcript-api`
4. If `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` set: also fetches title, channel, view counts, top comments
5. Sends transcript + comments to Grok for AI-first summary: TL;DR, Key Points, Notable Quotes, Themes, Comment Sentiment, Worth Following Up On
6. **Default save: auto-saves** to `Research/YouTube/YYYY-MM-DD - <video-title-slug>.md`

**`--visual` layer:** downloads the video (yt-dlp, <=720p) and extracts one frame per scene change (ffmpeg scene detection, not a fixed timer), so on-screen text, code, diagrams, slides, UI, and b-roll are captured. Hero frames are copied into `Research/YouTube/attachments/<slug>/` and embedded in the note; the full keyframe set is left on disk. The script prints a `FRAMES-FOR-CLAUDE` block - Claude then reads those frames (its own vision, no extra API call) and fills the note's `## Visual notes` section keyed by timestamp. Requires `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` on PATH; if missing or download fails, the visual layer is skipped and the transcript summary still saves. The pipeline is ported from claude-watch/claude-video (MIT).

Plain English: "summarize this YouTube video", "extract this video", "watch this video", "what's on screen", or just paste a YouTube URL with a question. Use `--visual` when the ask is about what is *shown*, not just said.

If the video has no captions and no API key set, the transcript path fails with a clear message; `--visual` can still read the video.

---

### `/podcast [url]`

**Extract and summarize a podcast episode.** Apple Podcasts URL or RSS feed → transcript (RSS `<podcast:transcript>` tag, Whisper API if `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, or show-notes fallback) → summarized via Grok.

Steps:
1. Parse Apple Podcasts URL (resolved to RSS via free iTunes Lookup API) or RSS feed URL
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.podcast_extract "<url>"`
3. Fetch episode metadata + audio URL + show notes from RSS
4. Try transcript sources in order: `<podcast:transcript>` tag → Whisper API (if `OPENAI_API_KEY`) → show-notes-only
5. Send transcript-or-shownotes to Grok for AI-first summary: TL;DR, Key Points, Notable Quotes, Themes, Guests & People Mentioned, Worth Following Up On
6. **Default save: auto-saves** to `Research/Podcasts/YYYY-MM-DD — <episode-title-slug>.md`

Plain English: "summarize this podcast", "what's in this episode", or just paste an Apple Podcasts URL.

Spotify URLs are not supported (DRM blocks audio + transcript access). If no transcript path works and show notes are empty, the script fails with a clear message.

---

### Cost tracking

`/x-read`, `/x-pulse`, `/youtube`, and `/podcast` (Grok summarize step) log usage to `~/.research-toolkit/usage.log`. View monthly totals via:
```bash
uv run python -c "from scripts.research.lib.usage import month_total; t,c = month_total(); print(f'\${t:.2f} across {c} calls')"
```

No usage tracking on Perplexity calls (intentional - user opted out).

No hard caps. No blocking. No per-call confirmation prompts. Trust the user to monitor.

---

## Scheduled Agents

Four autonomous agents designed to run on a schedule with no user intervention. Each runs a focused vault operation at a set time, then stops. They are conservative by default - they never delete or archive anything autonomously, and they never ask the user questions mid-run.

Set these up once using the `/schedule` skill in Claude Code.

---

### `obsidian-morning` - Daily at 8:00 AM

**Creates today's daily note and surfaces what needs attention.**

Prompt to schedule:
```
Read `index.md` first, then `_CLAUDE.md` if present. Create today's daily note in the resolved daily notes area using the Daily Note template.
Pull in any tasks from kanban boards that are due today or overdue.
List any projects with status active that have no recent activity in the last 7 days.
Do not ask questions — infer everything from the vault. Save and stop.
```

Setup:
```
/schedule obsidian-morning — daily 8:00 AM
```

---

### `obsidian-nightly` - Daily at 10:00 PM

**Sleeptime consolidation - the vault gets smarter overnight.**

This agent does more than close the day. It actively consolidates and improves the vault while you sleep.

Prompt to schedule:
```
Read `index.md` first, then `_CLAUDE.md` if present. This is a sleeptime consolidation pass - the vault should be smarter when the user wakes up.

Phase 1 — Close the day:
- Read today's daily note. Append a ## End of Day section with a 3-5 bullet summary.
- Move any completed kanban tasks to Done.

Phase 2 — Reconcile:
- Scan the resolved entities or people area for outdated roles, companies, or descriptions that conflict with newer daily notes.
- Scan the resolved concepts area for claims contradicted by recently ingested sources.
- Auto-resolve clear winners. Flag ambiguous ones in the resolved decisions area.

Phase 3 — Synthesize:
- Scan sources ingested today and yesterday. Find concepts that appear in 2+ unrelated sources.
- If patterns are found: create a synthesis note in the resolved concepts area with evidence and interpretation.

Phase 4 — Heal:
- Find notes created today with no incoming links. Add links from relevant existing pages.
- Check if any entity pages reference old timeline entries without an "until" date that should be closed.
- Rebuild index.md to reflect today's changes.

Phase 5 — Log:
- Append to log.md: ## [YYYY-MM-DD] nightly | End of day + X reconciled, Y synthesized, Z orphans linked

Do not ask questions. Do not fix anything destructive — only add, update, link. Save and stop.
```

Setup:
```
/schedule obsidian-nightly — daily 10:00 PM
```

---

### `obsidian-weekly` - Every Friday at 6:00 PM

**Generates a weekly review note from the vault.**

Prompt to schedule:
```
Read `index.md` first, then `_CLAUDE.md` if present. Run /obsidian-recap week to gather this week's activity.
Generate a weekly review note using the Review template (or standard structure if none exists).
Save to Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD — Weekly Review.md.
Link it from this week's last daily note.
Do not ask questions. Save and stop.
```

Setup:
```
/schedule obsidian-weekly — every Friday 6:00 PM
```

---

### `obsidian-health-check` - Every Sunday at 9:00 PM

**Runs the vault health check and logs a report.**

Prompt to schedule:
```
Read `index.md` first, then `_CLAUDE.md` if present. Run: python scripts/vault_health.py --path ~/path/to/vault --json
Parse the output. Write a health report to the resolved health-report area of the bundle
summarizing findings by severity (critical, warning, info).
Do not fix anything autonomously — only report.
Do not ask questions. Save and stop.
```

Setup:
```
/schedule obsidian-health-check — every Sunday 9:00 PM
```

---

### Setting up scheduled agents

All four can be configured at once:

```
/schedule
```

Then tell Claude which agents you want and at what times. Claude Code's scheduling system will handle the rest - agents run autonomously in the background on the defined cron schedule.

To list or remove scheduled agents:
```
/schedule list
/schedule remove obsidian-morning
```

### Running commands headless (`claude -p`) - important gotcha

Custom slash commands do NOT expand in non-interactive mode. A cron job or launchd
job that runs `claude -p "/obsidian-daily"` will send the literal text `/obsidian-daily`
as a prompt - Claude never loads the command file, so nothing happens.

The reliable pattern for any headless run (cron, launchd, a wrapper script) is to point
Claude at the command file and tell it to carry out the instructions:

```bash
# Wrong - the slash command is not expanded in -p mode:
claude -p "/obsidian-daily"

# Right - read the command file and execute its steps:
cd "$VAULT" && claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  -p "Read ~/.claude/commands/obsidian-daily.md and carry out its instructions exactly."
```

Because `~/.claude/commands/obsidian-daily.md` is symlinked from this repo (see Testing
locally in the README), a scheduled run always uses the current command logic. Export an
explicit `PATH` in launchd jobs - launchd strips the environment, so `claude` and `python3`
may not be found otherwise.

---

## Background Agent (PostCompact Hook)

A background agent that fires automatically whenever Claude compacts the conversation context. It reads the session summary and propagates everything worth preserving to the vault - no user action required.

**What it does:** After each compaction, a headless `claude -p` subprocess wakes up, reads `index.md` first and then any root extension files such as `_CLAUDE.md`, scans the summary for vault-worthy items (people, projects, decisions, tasks, dev work, ideas), and writes updates everywhere they belong - people notes, project notes, dev logs, kanban boards, and today's daily note.

**How it works:**
1. `PostCompact` hook fires in Claude Code after context compaction
2. Hook script reads the JSON summary from stdin
3. Spawns a headless `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p` subprocess in the vault directory
4. Agent runs silently, propagates updates, and exits - user sees nothing

**Setup:**

1. Make the hook script executable (one-time):
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/obsidian-second-brain/hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh
   ```

2. Set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "/path/to/your/vault"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add the `PostCompact` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PostCompact": [
         {
           "matcher": "",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "/Users/you/.claude/skills/obsidian-second-brain/hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh",
               "timeout": 10,
               "async": true
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

**Debugging:** The agent logs to `/tmp/obsidian-bg-agent.log`. Check there if updates aren't appearing.

**Safety:** The agent never deletes, archives, or merges anything. It only adds or updates. If the summary has nothing vault-worthy, it exits without touching the vault.

---

## Write-Time AI-First Validator (PostToolUse Hook)

A non-blocking validator that fires after every `Write` or `Edit` on a markdown file inside the configured vault. It warns when the file fails the AI-first rule (missing required frontmatter, missing `## For future Claude` preamble, broken YAML) and surfaces the warning back to Claude on stderr so the agent can repair the note in the same turn.

**What it checks:**
1. The file has frontmatter delimiters (`--- ... ---`)
2. No tabs in frontmatter (YAML requires spaces)
3. Required AI-first fields present: `date:`, `type:`, `tags:`, `ai-first: true`
4. The body contains a `## For future Claude` preamble (rule #2 of [`references/ai-first-rules.md`](references/ai-first-rules.md))

**What it skips:**
- Files outside `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
- Files under `raw/`, `templates/`, `_export/`, `.obsidian/`, `.git/`, `.trash/`

**Setup:**

1. Make the script executable (one-time):
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/obsidian-second-brain/hooks/validate-ai-first.sh
   ```

2. `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` must already be set in `~/.claude/settings.json` (the background agent setup above covers this).

3. Add the `PostToolUse` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PostToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "Write|Edit",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/obsidian-second-brain/hooks/validate-ai-first.sh"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

**Behavior:** Non-blocking. If a write fails the AI-first rule, Claude sees the warning text on stderr (with one line per missing requirement) and can re-write the file in the same conversation turn to fix it. The original write is NOT reverted.

**Other platforms (Codex CLI / Gemini CLI / OpenCode):** The hook script ships in `dist/<platform>/hooks/` for all platform builds, but each platform's hook system differs. Wiring it up beyond Claude Code is left to the platform's own configuration. See [`hooks/validate-ai-first.hook.yaml`](hooks/validate-ai-first.hook.yaml) for the platform-neutral spec.

## Per-Project Vaults (multi-repo workflows)

The default install path (`scripts/setup.sh`) writes `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` into `~/.claude/settings.json` (global). That assumes one machine = one vault. If you work across multiple repos and want each to have its own dedicated vault - or want to keep work and personal vaults separate without manually swapping config - use Claude Code's per-project settings to override the global setting on a per-directory basis.

**How it works:** every hook in this skill (`hooks/load_vault_context.py`, `hooks/validate-ai-first.sh`, `hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh`) reads `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` from process env at fire-time. Claude Code merges `.claude/settings.json` from the current project directory on top of `~/.claude/settings.json`, so a project-scoped env block overrides the global one for any session launched from that directory.

**Setup per repo:**

1. Bootstrap each vault once: `bash scripts/setup.sh` for the first vault (writes the global default), then `python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/vaults/repo-b --name "Your Name"` for any additional vaults (skips the global config step).

2. In each repo where you want a non-default vault, create `.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "/Users/you/vaults/repo-a-vault"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code (or open a new session in that directory). All slash commands, hooks, and scripts will now operate on the project-specific vault.

**What this does NOT give you:** isolation within a single vault. The skill has no `--scope` concept - `/obsidian-find`, `/obsidian-recap`, and `/obsidian-emerge` scan the entire configured vault. If you want multiple projects sharing one vault, you can organize them by top-level folders for visual grouping, but commands will still see across folders. A real `--scope` refactor is tracked in discussion threads - open a discussion if this is your use case.

**Slash commands and hooks are still globally installed.** Only the `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` env var is per-project. You do not need to re-symlink commands or re-register hooks per repo.
